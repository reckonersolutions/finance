git push -u origin master

…or import code from another repository

You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.


git pull origin master


I had the same problem as you.

I did git status git fetch git pull, but my branch was still behind to origin. I had folders and files pushed to remote and I saw the files on the web, but on my local they were missing.

Finally, these commands updated all the files and folders on my local:

git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master 

or if you want a branch

git checkout your_branch_name_here
git reset --hard origin/your_branch_name_here
